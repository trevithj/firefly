# Dev notes

## First version
Basic setup of the app. First thing, using  the `npm bootstrap` package failed to compile due to missing 'optional' packages. If time allowed, I'd look at the `webpack` config to see what was happening, but for now opted to use the CDN versions of the full packages.

## Version 2
Split the main panels out into their own components. Start a quick mock-up of the menu buttons.

## Version 3
Work on a mockup of the main panel. Less concerned here with styling, and more about getting basic functionality working. Styling even with Bootstrap is a bit of a time-suck, and can always be added in later.
